# Important in this specific build
The problem is:
(Maybe pretty hard:) No opening files in binarymode, idk if people even use it...
Some extra bugs I didn't find..

A bios file doesn't have to exist all the time!
You can make one, inject it, and then delete it :)

Please open up new issues on GitHub if you found any bugs (or post them in the forum :) )

Have fun!
